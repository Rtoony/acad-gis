# JoshyCAD Prototypes (ACAD-GIS)

This folder contains Python DXF generators and helpers used as prototypes. They demonstrate pure-Python design workflows without proprietary software.

Suggested next steps:
- Add a tiny CLI entry (`python app.py <tool> [args]`) to run generators
- Record outputs (DXF/GeoJSON) under a temp folder and list artifacts
- Iterate toward DB-backed tools that read/write ACAD-GIS projects/drawings
