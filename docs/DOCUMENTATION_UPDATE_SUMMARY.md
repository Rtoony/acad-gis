## üóëÔ∏è Documents to REPLACE

### 1. Replace TROUBLESHOOTING_QUICK.md
**Old file issues:**
- Didn't mention port 6543 vs 5432 issue
- Missing WSL-specific troubleshooting
- Incomplete connection test procedures

**New file has:**
- ‚úÖ Port 5432 fix documented
- ‚úÖ WSL Python package installation
- ‚úÖ Complete working `.env` template
- ‚úÖ Quick connection test script
- ‚úÖ Success checklist

**Action:** Download `TROUBLESHOOTING_QUICK_UPDATED.md` and replace existing file

---

### 2. Supplement WSL_SETUP.md
**Old file:** Good basics, but doesn't cover completion state

**New file (WSL_SETUP_COMPLETE.md):**
- ‚úÖ Everything from original PLUS
- ‚úÖ Verification that setup worked
- ‚úÖ Database connection success
- ‚úÖ All test results
- ‚úÖ Quick reference section
- ‚úÖ Daily workflow

**Action:** Keep both files OR replace old with new comprehensive version

---

### 3. Update DATABASE_CONNECTION.md

**Needs these additions:**
```markdown
## CRITICAL: Session Pooler Port

**Working configuration:**
- Port: 5432 (Session Pooler) ‚úÖ
- Port: 6543 (Transaction Pooler) ‚ùå

**Why this matters:**
Transaction pooler requires different authentication and may not work
with standard PostgreSQL clients. Always use port 5432.

## Current Working Password

Password: FFj9aBq8PtYNPaiz

Note: Password reset to uhY8zzuy4wLbAFBC did not take effect as of
October 19, 2025. Continue using FFj9aBq8PtYNPaiz.
```

**Action:** Add these sections to existing DATABASE_CONNECTION.md

---

### 4. Update DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md

**Needs these additions:**
```markdown
## Python Package Installation (WSL)

Due to Ubuntu 24.04 protecting system Python, use:
```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages PACKAGE_NAME
```

This is safe in WSL as it's an isolated environment.

## Working Directory

Recommended: /mnt/h/acad-gis
- Accessible from both Windows and WSL
- Faster than native WSL filesystem for Windows tools
- Easy to access from File Explorer

## Database Connection Verification

After any system restart, verify connection:
```bash
cd /mnt/h/acad-gis/backend
python3 database.py
```

Expected: ‚úÖ Connection successful with record counts
```

**Action:** Add these sections to existing DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md

---

## üì¶ File Organization
