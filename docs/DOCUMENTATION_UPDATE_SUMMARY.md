# Documentation Update Summary (Oct 2025)

Updated to reflect backend-first, open pipeline and thin UI.

Changes
- Rewrote `README.md` with vision, status, quick start, and links
- Replaced `docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` with backend-first milestones
- Replaced `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to match current repo (incl. prototypes)
- Added `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DXF_PIPELINE.md`, `docs/CONVERSION_PIPELINE.md`, `docs/GEODESY.md`, `docs/API.md`
- Replaced `docs/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md` with concise usage
- Replaced `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` to focus on API and paths
- Replaced `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_QUICK.md` (removed credentials, added common fixes)
- Added `prototypes/joshycad/README.md`
- Documented optional GIS processing setup (README, development environment, API guide, project structure)

Pending Consolidation
- Merge setup instructions (`SETUP_GUIDE.md`, `INSTALLATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `WSL_SETUP.md`) into one guide in a follow-up
- Move legacy snapshot docs to `archive/legacy-docs/` if desired
